Repo for Plop web applicaiton.

Requires a config.inc.php file to connect to the database, details of how to obtain one can be found at web.cs.manchester.ac.uk

Requires a magic database in a path defined in processFile.php (I have tried to include as many common linux paths as possible).

Please do not put files that are not needed into the repo, feel free to update .gitignore if you use them locally.
